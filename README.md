***So far, the internet has not provided us with anything good***

I find myself reflecting on this more often. The internet promised us connectivity, empowerment, and endless opportunities. Instead, we face a reality filled with hatred, over-engineered content, AI-generated noise, and the weight of depression.

The internet resembles a minefield. No matter what you click on, what actions you take, and who you communicate with. Large corporations, political groups, and governments are constantly watching, influencing, and guiding your choices, without your awarness.

The number of people who are aware and genuinely care is far fewer than it should be.
